"""Serial Stream to CSV

This script connects to a serial communication port specified
in the command line arguments. The port is then continuously polled for data
until told to stop. The data is split by spaces and then written to a csv file
specified in the command line arguments.

The original intent of this script was to record a stream of sensor
readings from an arduino over time. The csv data could then be
used to analyze the data and test various processing techniques
without the need to have physical hardware.

Data over being sent over the serial connection should follow this packet protocol

    <data> <data> <data> ...
