-- This section contains all settings
-- related to data filtering
filtering:
  -- This is the amount of samples that will
  -- be used when computing the moving average.
  --
  -- IMPORTANT: This downsamples the frequency.
  -- For example, ADC samples at 10kHz. If the
  -- bin size is 10 samples, then our true
  -- sampling frequency is 1kHz (10 kHz / 10)
  avg_bin_size: 10

  -- This is the amount of samples used to compute
  -- the FFT. This should be based on the true sampling
  -- frequency as described above. For example, this defaults
  -- to 1000 samples which is equal to our true sampling frequency
  -- of 1kHz meaning we perform a FFT every 1 second
  fft_bin_size: 1000

  -- The velocity is detected by the dominant frequency in our FFT.
  -- This is computed by finding the greatest magnitude in the spectrum
  -- and outputting the corresponding frequency.
  --
  -- The frequency threshold limits which frequencies can be considered
  -- dominant. Think of it as a high pass filter. I found there to be a lot
  -- of noise in the lower frequencies that would dominant any other frequencies.
  -- I set this to 6 because it equates to 0.45 m/s for our radar. I figured
  -- anything below that was not worth detecting.
  --
  -- May be beneficial to adjust.
  fft_freq_threshold: 6

  -- The magnitude threshold limits which magnitudes can be considered max. 
  -- This is meant to combat noise. If no mangitudes are detected above this
  -- setting, the frequency will be assumed 0 and no movement will be recorded.
  --
  -- I found most noise occurs under 1 and anything greater should be considered movement.
  -- This depends on the returned amplitude of the doppler shift, however.
  -- Adjusting may be beneficial.
  fft_mag_threshold: 0.9

  -- This is the amount of samples used to remove 
  -- impulsive noise. Generally, higher is better, but
  -- too high and the signal will be smoothed too much.
  -- I had good results with 50
  impulse_bin_size: 50
