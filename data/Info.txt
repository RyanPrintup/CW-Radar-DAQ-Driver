test1 and test2 were performed with a single output amplifier with 63db gain.
We may be able to improve our SNR by adding a second stage amplifier, as the ADC noise may be larger than the radar noise still.
movement_test: a mix of tests, walking away from and toward the radar, moving toward/away with somewhat constant velocity,
    wiggling hands back and forth at various speeds
respiratory_test: me sitting still in a chair close to the radar, to see if we can do breathing. 
    the large spikes at the beginning and end is me moving to turn the script on/off
